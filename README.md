# Vigen-re-cipher
In the Caesar cipher, each letter of the alphabet is shifted by several positions; 
for example, in a Caesar cipher, with a shift of +3, A would become D, B would become E, and so on.
The Vigenère cipher consists of a sequence of several Caesar ciphers with different shift values.
For encryption, a table of alphabets called the tabula recta or Vigenère's square (table) can be used. 
With regard to the Latin alphabet, the Vigenère table is made up of lines of 26 characters each, with each next line shifted by several positions. 
Thus, there are 26 different Caesar ciphers in the table. Each stage of encryption uses different alphabets, selected depending on the character of the keyword.
